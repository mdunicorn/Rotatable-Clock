# Rotatable-Clock
A semi-transparent semi-3D clock!

This is a sample project, I created to showcase abilities of WPF.

The clock rotates backwards! This is intentional, to create confusion! :)

### Features

The clock can be moved (dragged) using the mouse, and can be rotated around x and y axes using arrow keys.

Press Alt+F4 to close the clock.
